of independent travel</strong>, and the camaraderie of a small group of travelling friends, but really wouldn&#8217;t enjoy a typical &#8220;corporate&#8221; group tour. Since 2014, Yomadic &#8220;untours&#8221; have combined the best aspects of freestyle travel, wrapped inside a curated (but flexible) itinerary.</p><p>These are the <strong>best</strong> available small-gang Tunisia tours<strong>, and we personally invite you to join us. </strong></p><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-18693 size-woocommerce_thumbnail" src="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-best-tours-133x89.jpg" alt="tunisia best tours" width="133" height="89" srcset="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-best-tours-133x89.jpg 133w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-best-tours-266x178.jpg 266w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-best-tours-432x288.jpg 432w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-best-tours-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-best-tours.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" />From Tunis, the busy Mediterranean capital once the heart of the Roman Empire in Africa, you&#8217;ll take an immersive journey into the Sahara and back. Situated between endless desert sands and crisp sea waters, millennia of civilizations have called Tunisia home &#8211; Cathegenians, Romans, Phoenicians, Spanish, Arabs, Ottomans &#8211; leading to a truly unique and contemporary blend of Europe and Africa.<br /> <a id="tunisia-tours-reviews"></a><br /> <img class="alignleft size-woocommerce_thumbnail wp-image-18690" src="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-tours-sahara-133x89.jpg" alt="tunisia tours sahara" width="133" height="89" srcset="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-tours-sahara-133x89.jpg 133w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-tours-sahara-266x178.jpg 266w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-tours-sahara-432x288.jpg 432w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-tours-sahara-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-tours-sahara.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" />Winding medinas, life-sustaining Oases, great food, friendly laid back people, and world-class reminders leftover from the clash of empires &#8211; there is so much to discover. Our local experience will lead you from iconic UNESCO sites to those special, locals-only, off-the-beaten-path places that don&#8217;t show on any other itinerary. Most importantly, you&#8217;ll have time to simply relax and let Tunisia come to you.</p><blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;BEST TRAVEL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Hanif C., Canada</p><p><strong>&#8220;There are many unbelievable moments in that trip that never would have happened had we gone by ourselves&#8230; one of the best things I&#8217;ve ever done.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Kate M., Australia</p><p><strong>&#8220;Trip of a lifetime&#8230; I&#8217;d do it again.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Melissa B., USA</p><p><strong>&#8220;&#8230;would do it all over again right now.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; John G., USA</p><p><strong>&#8220;&#8230;single best travel experience of my life!&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Rachel W., Australia</p><p><strong>&#8220;&#8230;one of the best, if not the best trip I’ve ever made&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Serge B, Luxembourg<br /> <a id="iran-tours-dates"></a><br /> <strong>&#8220;</strong><strong>I was so glad that I came along as I was never really into guided tours.

You may be a little tired from the flight, so a guided walking tour through a living labyrinth of history will be a relaxing way to discover this alluring capital city.</li><li>nearby Tunis Medina, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is a city-within-a-city &#8211; home to thousands of residents, market stalls, restaurants, and some of the most important Mosques in Tunisia. We&#8217;ll have time for an expert overview of what makes this city tick, and taste a little local flavour as we go.</li><li>get-to-know-you dinner will be at the best restaurant in Tunis (in our humble opinion)(and we&#8217;ll feel bad if you don&#8217;t allow us to pay)</li></ul><h6>Whilst in Tunis, we&#8217;ll spend two nights at a downtown historical hotel. Perfect location, comfortable rooms, inside an extensively restored classical building (with a great breakfast).</h6><h5>DAY 2 &#8211; LAYERS UPON LAYERS UPON LAYERS<strong><br /> </strong></h5><ul><li><img class="alignleft size-woocommerce_thumbnail wp-image-18705" src="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/sea-tunis-133x89.jpg" alt="sea tunis" width="133" height="89" srcset="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/sea-tunis-133x89.jpg 133w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/sea-tunis-266x178.jpg 266w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/sea-tunis-432x288.jpg 432w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/sea-tunis-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/sea-tunis.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" />Travel to the nearby Mediterranean coastline, discovering the oldest part of Tunis, and<strong> &#8211; </strong>another UNESCO World Heritage site &#8211; the city of Carthage. For centuries, Arch-nemesis of the Romans, and the birthplace of Hannibal &#8211; who famously journeyed his army of elephants into Europe. Carthage is varied &#8211; from the enormous Roman-era Cisterns of La Malga, to mysterious sites of infant sacrifice, and we&#8217;ll check out some of the more worthy spots.</li><li>speaking of the sea, after exploring Carthage we&#8217;ll head over to the beach-side town of La Goulette to eat. Fresh fish, grilled seafood, it&#8217;s a popular place for the locals and you&#8217;ll start to get under the skin of Tunis (but you won&#8217;t see any other tourists).</li><li>heading back to Tunis, we&#8217;ll explore the modern-day bustling city, taking in some of the secrets, and ending the day with dinner. You may want to explore the nearby medina on your own, after all, the Tunis Medina holds a lifetime of discoveries (we&#8217;ll be there to assist with any guidance and suggestions). We&#8217;d love to show you some quirky highlights (hashtag brutalist architecture).</li></ul><h6>Tonight is your second night in the little-bit-fancy downtown historical hotel.</h6><h5>DAY 3 – TUNIS TO KAIROUAN</h5><ul><li><img class="alignleft size-woocommerce_thumbnail wp-image-18706" src="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/kairouan-tunisia-tours-133x89.jpg" alt="kairouan tunisia tours" width="133" height="89" srcset="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/kairouan-tunisia-tours-133x89.jpg 133w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/kairouan-tunisia-tours-266x178.jpg 266w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/kairouan-tunisia-tours-432x288.jpg 432w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/kairouan-tunisia-tours-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/kairouan-tunisia-tours.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" />Leaving Tunis, we&#8217;ll hit the road early and stop at Sousse &#8211; a busy port city in the Gulf of Hammamet. At its core, the millennia-old narrow streets of Sousse are a great demonstration of Tunisian architectural diversity, so we&#8217;ll wander, explore, take in some fortified history (with rooftop views), and check out the most incredible Roman-era mosaics.</li><li>Wandering around is the perfect way to see Sousse, and build up an appetite &#8211; and our reward will be some more of that great Tunisian cuisine.</li><li>by the afternoon, we&#8217;ll arrive in the small city of Kairouan. Another change of era&#8217;s &#8211; Kairouan is one of the most important Islamic places on Earth. Local highlights include the UNESCO listed Grand Mosque, offbeat must-sees include the place where Muhammad&#8217;s barber is laid to rest (yes, that Muhammad). Relax, explore, or even (clears throat) just rock the local Kasbah.</li></ul><h6>Tonight, we&#8217;ll spend a night inside the Kasbah, at a five-star hotel that fuses ancient traditions with contemporary standards (in Tunisia even the accommodations are highlights).</h6><h5>DAY 4 – EL DJEM TO DJERBA</h5><ul><li><img class="alignleft size-woocommerce_thumbnail wp-image-18707" src="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tour-el-jem-tunisia-133x89.jpg" alt="tour el jem tunisia" width="133" height="89" srcset="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tour-el-jem-tunisia-133x89.jpg 133w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tour-el-jem-tunisia-266x178.jpg 266w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tour-el-jem-tunisia-432x288.jpg 432w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tour-el-jem-tunisia-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tour-el-jem-tunisia.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" />Heading deeper into the South of Tunisia (queue Banjo music), but first, we&#8217;ll check out yet another UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site. OK, by this point, it may seem that UNESCO hands out these designations like candy &#8211; with little ol&#8217; Tunisia containing eight. However, the Amphitheatre of El Jem is ridiculously worthy &#8211; unique in Africa, and one of the largest, best-preserved, Roman amphitheatres in the world.</li><li>en-route destinations today include the Aghlabid Basins &#8211; a grand hydraulic structure built by the Arab dynasty in the 9th century, providing water to the people of Kairouan for over a millennium. Plus, we have another surprise (or two).</li><li>after exploring El Jem, we&#8217;ll continue to Djerba &#8211; often referred to as &#8220;the Island of Dreams&#8221;. Catching a leisurely ferry is the perfect way to enter the laid-back Tunisian Mediterranean island. Rich with both history and contemporary arts &#8211; known for the ancient Jewish community near &#8220;Djerbahood&#8221;, where 250 artists from all around the world have left their works on the city streets.</li><li>Ending the day we&#8217;ll relax, eat, and spend the night on Djerba island.</li></ul><h6>Our accommodation in Djerba will be in a traditional, and quiet, boutique guest house.</h6><h5>DAY 5 – LEAVING DJERBAHOOD, ENTERING TATAOUINE</h5><ul><li><img class="alignleft size-woocommerce_thumbnail wp-image-18708" src="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/abandoned-hotel-tunisia-133x89.jpg" alt="abandoned hotel tunisia" width="133" height="89" srcset="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/abandoned-hotel-tunisia-133x89.jpg 133w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/abandoned-hotel-tunisia-266x178.jpg 266w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/abandoned-hotel-tunisia-432x288.jpg 432w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/abandoned-hotel-tunisia-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/abandoned-hotel-tunisia.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" />Djerbahood is best explored on foot, and we&#8217;ll visit some local highlights including the historic Jewish Synagogue &#8211; architecturally stunning, with deep religious importance. On the walls of Djerbahood, the contemporary artworks are everywhere &#8211; so we are unlikely to run out of photo opportunities.</li><li>let&#8217;s be honest- cheesy package tourists love Djerba. If you want to spend a week in a typical seaside resort, not seeing anything else, Djerba is for you. However, we like to educate and amuse, so we have a very special resort just for you&#8230;</li><li>Tanit Hotel resort is completely abandoned, beautifully decaying &#8211; and happens to be located on the sands of Tunisia&#8217;s nicest beach. We&#8217;ll stop in, check it out, learn about Tunisia&#8217;s &#8220;Jasmine Revolution&#8221; the 2011 civil protest that ended decades of corruption, sparked the Arab Spring, and Tanit Hotel is a perfect reminder of the economic turmoil that followed. Listen, take a few photos of the resort, or take a dip in some truly stunning warm waters &#8211; we&#8217;ll wait.</li><li>for lunch, Djerba has a lively Medina with a special twist &#8211; fisherman string up their catch, and display it to curious buyers. We&#8217;ll select what we need, and ask a local restaurant to grill up our &#8220;catch&#8221;, served with fresh salads and Tunisian sides.</li><li>in the afternoon, we’ll cross the first of our Sahara-salt-lakes, head into the beginnings of the real desert, and arrive in Tataouine.</li><li>after a long day of adventure, we think a BBQ by the pool would be perfect, before nodding off and sleeping in another galaxy far, far, away.</li></ul><h6>In Tataouine, for two nights everyone has a comfortable stone-house in the shadow of the rocky mountains.</h6><h5>DAY 6 – HILLTOP HOODS</h5><ul><li><img class="alignleft size-woocommerce_thumbnail wp-image-18717" src="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-ksar-tours-133x89.jpg" alt="tours" width="133" height="89" srcset="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-ksar-tours-133x89.jpg 133w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-ksar-tours-266x178.jpg 266w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-ksar-tours-432x288.jpg 432w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-ksar-tours-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-ksar-tours.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" />Today is all about Tataouine. You&#8217;ll see the variety of dwellings and lifestyles of the locals &#8211; from hilltop caves to below-ground dugouts. It&#8217;s a full day of exploring, and we&#8217;ll see the best of the best. We&#8217;ll ask the locals to prepare a traditional Berber meal for us, and stop for a cup of tea and a snack inside the quaint cave of some local friends</li><li>Luke Skywalkers house is around here &#8211; Star Wars fan or not, this area is among the most visually stunning areas you will ever see. Tataouine was good enough for one of the most famous Hollywood Directors of all time, so our photos should look great.</li><li>up in the mountains is &#8220;Chenini&#8221; an ancient Berber village tucked into the cliffs, former &#8220;Ksar&#8221; (fortified storage facility), and OK, yes Star Wars nerds we know Chenini is also the name of one of the moons on Luke Skywalker&#8217;s home planet.</li><li>after a full day of exploring, we&#8217;ll return to our hotel and get some rest for tomorrow&#8217;s journey into the greatest desert on Earth.</li></ul><h6>Your second night in Tataouine, inside your comfortable stone-house (the pool is a short walk away).</h6><h5><strong>DAY 7 – SAHARA MEANS DESERT<br /> </strong></h5><ul><li><img class="alignleft size-woocommerce_thumbnail wp-image-18690" src="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-tours-sahara-133x89.jpg" alt="tunisia tours sahara" width="133" height="89" srcset="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-tours-sahara-133x89.jpg 133w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-tours-sahara-266x178.jpg 266w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-tours-sahara-432x288.jpg 432w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-tours-sahara-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tunisia-tours-sahara.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" />Up over the mountains (stopping for coffee with an amazing view), we&#8217;ll spend the day travelling into the Sahara desert, and we’ll need to swap our comfortable bus for a set of off-road equipped vehicles. Along the way, we have a few surprises &#8211; some above ground, some below. We know a hot-water desert-spring where the wild camels will usually be hanging out drinking.</li><li>lunch, we&#8217;re planning on eating inside a traditional troglodytes home (the temperature is always perfect, and the not-expected interior decorating could be described as &#8220;Grandma-ish&#8221;)</li><li>heading off-road and into the desert, we&#8217;ll arrive in the middle of nowhere &#8211; sixty miles from the nearest human settlement, and thirty miles from the closest source of water (don’t worry, we&#8217;ll bring more than enough).</li><li>finally, we will reach our destination &#8211; our campsite in the Sahara (with enough all-terrain-vehicles to share and explore some of the more remote desert sites).</li><li>by night, we’ll enjoy a traditional Berber dinner (and of course a desert camp-fire).</li><li>stargazing after a good meal will take your breath away. With zero light pollution (since the closest source of electricity is two hours drive away from our camp), you&#8217;ll witness the galaxy with a clarity you may not have believed is possible.</li></ul><h6>Our accommodations for tonight are comfortable desert camp tents, but feel free to sleep out under the stars.</h6><h5>DAY 8 – TOZEUR TREEHOUSE</h5><ul><li><img class="alignleft size-woocommerce_thumbnail wp-image-18720" src="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tozeur-tours-tunis-133x89.jpg" alt="tozeur tours tunis" width="133" height="89" srcset="https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tozeur-tours-tunis-133x89.jpg 133w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tozeur-tours-tunis-266x178.jpg 266w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tozeur-tours-tunis-432x288.jpg 432w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tozeur-tours-tunis-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/tozeur-tours-tunis.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" />Leaving the Sahara desert in the morning, we&#8217;ll cross the vast salt lake of Chott el Djerid. Shimmering with hues of green, red and white, we&#8217;ll take the one narrow road that allows us to cross safely (stopping in the middle to check out the pink salt lake), before continuing on to the small town of Douz &#8211; just a stone&#8217;s throw from the Algerian border.</li><li>Douz is small and lively and makes for a perfect lunch stop.</li><li>there is a seriously unique stop en-route today, the Tunisian-only Les Refroidisseurs d&#8217;Eau &#8211; a huge concrete facility built to process, cool, and store, the hot water that flows up from underground the desert sands.

Stopping for picturesque views, you will truly feel like you&#8217;re in the middle of nowhere. There&#8217;s a special visit to the famous Mos Espa townsite, decaying in the middle of the desert.

The choices below are made with one goal: Tunisia is a once-in-lifetime destination, and we want you to have the best, most authentic, Tunisia experience.</p><h5>TRANSPORTATION</h5><p><strong>Private transport, with the same driver, and the same bus, available 100% of the time. </strong>Modern, spacious, comfortable, air-conditioned. Our hand-picked local drivers are <strong>safe, experienced, and friendly</strong>.</p><p><em>Reliable private transportation is the key to seeing Tunisia &#8211; it&#8217;s a must &#8211; along with a calm and professional driver.</em></p><h5>ACCOMMODATION</h5><p>Stunning traditional accommodation, stylish hotels, <strong>your own tree-house apartment for a few nights</strong>, and Sahara desert glamping in tents under the stars &#8211; <strong>you&#8217;ll enjoy the variety.</strong> We personally <strong>hand-select every hotel</strong>, and we&#8217;ve played an advisory role in improving the standards at many Tunisian hotels. <strong>Shared rooms have a maximum of two guests in total. </strong>All accommodation is perfectly located, comfortable, quiet, with helpful staff, good breakfast, and the fastest WiFi possible. We&#8217;re looking for a &#8220;five-star&#8221; experience, every night.<strong><br /> </strong></p><h5>MEALS &#8211; EVERY BREAKFAST, EVERY LUNCH, MANY DINNERS</h5><p>We absolutely love Tunisian food and great restaurants. All Yomadic tours include <strong>breakfast and lunch every single day. </strong>Order whatever you like, <strong>it&#8217;s all included</strong>. Usually, we&#8217;ll be sitting down at a restaurant (we know the best local joints in each city), but we don&#8217;t mind the occasional picnic or tasty street-food snacks. Hearty, local, fresh, plenty of variety, and we&#8217;ll take care of your dietary requirements.</p><p><em>Note: we include tea, coffee, desserts (and deserts), juices, water, ice-cream, and more.<br /> </em></p><p>By nights you&#8217;ll have decisions to make &#8211; you&#8217;re always welcome to join us, or go it alone. We could be dining at the finest in the city, the local hole-in-the-wall, or hitting the streets for some Tunisian fast-food. If you need advice and want a recommendation, we&#8217;ll point you in the direction of a great meal.</p><p>Also, we&#8217;d feel awkward if we didn&#8217;t pay for dinner at least a few times.</p><h5>AND MORE INCLUSIONS&#8230;</h5><p><strong>Entrance fees</strong> to all attractions we visit. <strong>Our bus is connected to the Internet</strong> whenever you need it (where available). Coffee and cake. Snacks and drinks. We&#8217;ll help you out with customs, cultures, and currency exchange.

Every year, we personally spend months in Tunisia &#8211; running tours and furthering our relationships with our guides, contacts, and partners.

As with many countries around the world, Tunisia has in the past sadly experienced acts of terrorism. However, these were limited in scope, or solo isolated incidents. Tunisia is a stable democratic nation, a beacon of Africa, with no ongoing conflicts.</p><h5>Will I get a Visa?</h5><p>Most nationalities do not require a visa. For citizens of the EU, USA, Canada, Australia, and much of the world, nothing needs to be done, you may freely land and enter Tunisia the same as entering any other country.

You will enjoy the variety &#8211; and always get a great nights rest. You&#8217;ll have a private bathroom with a western-style toilet. If you&#8217;re sharing, it will be a maximum of two people in each room.</p><h5>Who are our guides?</h5><p>Our local guides are genuine experts. We only use guides who are independent, freelance, and love their job. They&#8217;re fluent in English (and other languages), and always have a friendly and relaxed disposition. Qualified in areas such as architecture and history, they&#8217;re highly experienced and happy to meet tourists of all nationalities.</p><p>Most importantly, our guides understand the atmosphere and experience of a Yomadic &#8220;untour&#8221; &#8211; when you want to relax and take in Tunisia in your own way, they&#8217;ll give you plenty of time and space. When you need info or advice, they&#8217;ll be magically nearby. Prediction: you&#8217;ll want to spend as much time as possible with your guide.</p><h5>About your guide(s) for this tour</h5><p>On this tour, you will exclusively have the dream-team.

An avid researcher with unique insight into the history and archaeology of Tunisia, Ghazi will happily chat about the many questions you are sure to have whilst exploring his homeland.</p><p>With seventeen years of experience, Ghazi is recognized as one of the leading guides and mentors in Tunisia. He&#8217;s a lot of fun to be around &#8211; and always knows where the closest local cafe or restaurant is. Our number one Tunisian guide, we couldn&#8217;t ask for a more perfect Yomadic team member.</p><h5>What if I’m travelling solo, will I need to pay extra?</h5><p>You pay the same price whether you’re solo or not. <strong>There is no single supplement fee or charge &#8211; if you&#8217;re happy to twin-share with a maximum of one other person.</strong> If you do want your own room&#8230;</p><h5>What if I would prefer my own room, guaranteed?</h5><p>Don’t want to play bunk buddy? Prefer your privacy? No problems, <strong>for a single supplement of €650, you will have your own room every night.</strong> Just let us know, we&#8217;ll arrange it. If not, you will share with a maximum of one other person.</p><h5>What if I get sick of hanging out with you guys?</h5><p>We&#8217;ve designed the trip so you have time to explore and wander &#8211; day and night. Make sure you&#8217;re back by the time we drive to the next city, or else we will kill you.</p><h5>Arriving and departing, early or late?</h5><p>If you would like to <strong>arrive early or depart late</strong>, we will pre-book accommodation for you, and provide easy instructions on how to get to your hotel (you&#8217;ll need to spring for the cost of the extra hotel nights). We will do our best to accommodate late arrivals, please contact us to explain your situation. As for leaving early &#8211; you would make us sad, but we’ll make sure you&#8217;re safely on your way.</p><h5>Anything else you should know?</h5><ul><li>You are responsible for obtaining any Tunisia travel visas you may need &#8211; of course, we&#8217;ll assist.</li><li>You should have travel insurance, you are responsible for organising this.</li><li>Travel can be unpredictable. Things may change. So, in the unlikely event that any major changes to the itinerary are required, we will discuss and keep you in the loop at all times. <strong>Our goal is to make all changes for the best, putting you first.</strong></li><li>In the extremely unlikely event that the tour is cancelled by us (<b>we&#8217;ve never cancelled a tour</b>), you will receive a<strong> full 100% refund</strong> (unless the trip cancellation is due to a &#8220;force majeure&#8221; event &#8211; something beyond our control such as a natural disaster). However &#8211; even in that situation &#8211; we will always strive to provide you a full refund and go to all lengths to protect our reputation &#8211; and your satisfaction.</li><li>We have been running tours since 2014, and are genuine experts.</li></ul><h5>What if I have paid, and then I change my mind?</h5><p>We understand &#8211; sometimes the best-made travel plans need to be put on hold, or cancelled. Unfortunately, we incur very real and substantial costs from the moment you book. However, we don&#8217;t want to act all big and corporate, so we promise:</p><ul><li>if you cancel before 100 days of the tour start date, 500 Euro of each ticket may be non-refundable (read on). Due to the increasing popularity of visiting, and the small number of suitable accommodations, we are booking your room well in advance and have genuine non-refundable costs.</li><li>if you cancel between 75 and 100 days before the tour start date you <strong>may</strong> lose up to 50% of your ticket price.</li><li>if you cancel within 75 days of the tour start date, you <strong>may</strong> lose up to 100% of your ticket price (this is due to the difficulties in finding a replacement for you at such short notice).</li><li><strong>HOWEVER &#8211; WE WILL ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING &#8211; so, if we fill your seat after you cancel, we will refund a MINIMUM of 90% of your full ticket price.</strong></li></ul><h5>What if I still have some unanswered questions?</h5><p>Get in touch!

I’m convinced and can’t wait to come along&#8230;. how do I pay?</h5><p>Our Tunisia tours sell-out fast &#8211; a big reason for that is a high number of repeat-trippers and personal recommendations.
